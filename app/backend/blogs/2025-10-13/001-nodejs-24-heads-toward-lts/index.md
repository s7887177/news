# Node.js 24 Heads Toward LTS: A Quietly Huge Shift for Developers

![hero]

If you write JavaScript or TypeScript for the backend, there’s a big transition coming your way — and you might not even notice it until something breaks.
**Node.js 24**, the latest major release, is now the “Current” version and will soon become **LTS (Long-Term Support)** in **October 2025**. That means it’s about to become the *default* version for most production environments, cloud providers, and Docker images.

But this LTS cycle is special. Under the hood, Node.js 24 brings several architectural and ecosystem-level changes that affect how we build, test, and even *secure* our apps.


## Goodbye MSVC, Hello ClangCL (Windows Developers, Pay Attention)

One of the most notable shifts:

> Node.js 24 **drops support for Microsoft’s MSVC compiler** on Windows and now requires **ClangCL**.

If you’re on Windows and you ever build native modules (e.g., bcrypt, sharp, node-gyp projects), you might have relied on Visual Studio’s C++ toolchain in the past. With Node 24, that’s changing.

ClangCL is LLVM’s compiler front-end that mimics the MSVC command-line interface — but it’s **more consistent across platforms** and aligns Node’s build process with Linux and macOS.
This change should reduce cross-platform inconsistencies, but it also means some older modules might need patching or recompiled binaries. Expect some build friction initially.

> ✅ **What you should do:**
>
> * If you maintain native addons, test builds with ClangCL now.
> * If you use precompiled binaries (like sharp or node-sass), watch for updated releases from maintainers.


## Built-in Test Runner Gets Smarter

Node.js 24 continues evolving its **native test runner**, which was introduced in Node 18 and has quietly matured since.

The new update automates **waiting for subtests** — something that used to require custom logic or libraries like Mocha or Jest. You can now write structured tests directly in Node without external tooling:

```js
import test from 'node:test';
import assert from 'node:assert';

test('main suite', async (t) => {
  await t.test('subtest 1', () => {
    assert.strictEqual(1 + 1, 2);
  });

  await t.test('subtest 2', () => {
    assert.ok(true);
  });
});
```

This doesn’t mean Jest or Vitest are going away — but it does mean **Node’s test ecosystem is maturing natively**, and smaller projects can ditch extra dependencies altogether.

> ✅ **What you should do:**
> Try the built-in runner for utility scripts or libraries where minimalism matters. It’s fast, zero-config, and works with `--test`.


## Better Async Context Tracking and HTTP Performance

Under the hood, Node 24 upgrades **async context propagation**, improving how asynchronous calls preserve context across `await` boundaries — something frameworks like Express and Next.js rely on for logging, tracing, and error handling.

The built-in **HTTP stack also gains performance from Undici 7**, the next iteration of Node’s modern HTTP client, bringing closer parity with browser fetch performance.

> ✅ **What you should do:**
> If you build custom observability or tracing systems, check whether your context management depends on legacy async hooks. The new behavior is more consistent but may expose hidden assumptions.


## The Supply-Chain Problem Just Got Louder

While the Node core team is improving developer experience, the ecosystem itself just faced a harsh wake-up call.

A malware campaign dubbed **“Shai-Hulud”** recently hit npm, compromising **hundreds of packages** with credential-stealing payloads and worm-like propagation logic — likely the largest supply-chain breach in npm’s history.

At the same time, another malware, **Stealit**, is abusing Node’s **Single Executable Application (SEA)** feature — allowing attackers to ship trojanized binaries that execute JavaScript payloads on machines without Node even installed.

This combination — a massive registry compromise *plus* abuse of new packaging features — underscores a simple reality:

> The Node.js ecosystem is powerful, but **its openness is also its biggest attack surface**.

To address this, researchers are proposing **NodeShield**, a runtime system that enforces declared dependencies from an application’s **SBOM** (Software Bill of Materials).
It could become an important security layer, ensuring that a running Node app never loads undeclared or tampered modules.

> ✅ **What you should do:**
>
> * Use `npm audit` and `npm fund` regularly.
> * Pin versions in production.
> * Avoid `latest` tags and dynamic imports from unknown sources.
> * Watch for security advisories — the npm team is actively patching affected packages.


## Why This Release Matters

Node.js 24 isn’t flashy — it’s foundational.
It represents a **shift toward stability, security, and modernization**:

* Aligning compiler toolchains across platforms
* Building serious first-party testing and HTTP tooling
* Improving async context consistency
* Taking supply-chain threats seriously

If you’re running long-lived applications, this LTS release will likely define your backend environment for the next two years. It’s worth testing now.


## TL;DR
Node.js 24 is a quiet revolution.
It doesn’t introduce shiny APIs — it makes the ecosystem *safer*, *more predictable*, and *more future-proof*.
And that’s exactly what the JavaScript backend world needs right now.
